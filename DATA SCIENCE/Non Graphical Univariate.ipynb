    "# Univariate analysis is an essential component of data exploration and analysis. While visualizations like histograms and box plots are commonly used for this purpose, non-graphical methods can provide valuable insights as well. In this article, we'll dive into univariate analysis without relying on graphs, focusing on techniques such as value counts and binning.\n",

    "# Understanding Univariate Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "# Univariate analysis involves the examination of a single variable in isolation. It allows us to gain insights into the distribution, central tendency, and variability of that variable. Non-graphical univariate analysis techniques are particularly useful when dealing with categorical or discrete data, or when a simplified summary is needed.\n",

    "# Value Counts\n",
    "\n",
    "# Value counts are a straightforward and informative way to analyze the distribution of categorical data. This technique involves counting the occurrences of each unique category or value within a variable. Python's Pandas library provides a convenient method for this: value_counts().\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Suppose you have a dataset containing information about customer satisfaction levels (categories: \"High,\" \"Medium,\" \"Low\"). You can perform a value count analysis as follows:"
