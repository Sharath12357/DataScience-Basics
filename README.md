Data Cleaning, Preprocessing, and EDA
This project focuses on essential data science techniques including data cleaning, data preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The goal is to demonstrate various methods of preparing datasets for machine learning, analyzing data patterns, and dealing with common issues like missing values and duplicates.

Key Topics Covered:
Data Cleaning

Removing irrelevant data or noise from the dataset.
Correcting data inconsistencies.
Dealing with duplicate entries.
Data Preprocessing

Encoding categorical variables (e.g., Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding).
Scaling/normalizing data to ensure that models perform well.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performing univariate and bivariate analysis to understand the data's distribution.
Visualizing the data through various plots like histograms, box plots, and scatter plots.
Handling Missing Values

Identifying missing data.
Techniques for handling missing values (e.g., imputation, deletion).
Handling outliers and extreme values.
Univariate Analysis

Understanding individual feature distributions.
Using visualizations like histograms and bar charts to analyze single variables.
Bivariate Analysis

Analyzing the relationships between two variables.
Scatter plots, correlation analysis, and more to detect patterns.
Handling Duplicate Values

Identifying duplicate rows.
Removing or addressing duplicates to avoid bias in the analysis.
